# Code Fixes Summary

## Issues Resolved ‚úÖ

### 1. **Fixed Redbird Import Error**
- **Issue**: `TypeError: proxy.on is not a function` and `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'get')`
- **Root Cause**: The Redbird API doesn't expose event handlers or Express app directly
- **Fix**: Removed unsupported event handlers and custom Express routes from `proxy.js`

### 2. **Fixed Invalid URI Error**
- **Issue**: `Error: uri is not a valid http uri http:///`
- **Root Cause**: Source URLs were being passed as paths (e.g., `/api`) instead of full URLs
- **Fix**: Modified route building to construct full source URLs like `http://localhost:80/api`

### 3. **Fixed Console Log Mismatch**
- **Issue**: `proxy-simple.js` showed incorrect target port in console output
- **Fix**: Updated console.log to show correct port (5173 instead of 3000)

## Files Modified üìù

### `/workspace/proxy.js`
- Fixed source URL construction for all routes
- Removed unsupported `proxy.app` usage
- Removed unsupported event handlers (`proxy.on`)
- Removed health check endpoints (not supported by current Redbird API)

### `/workspace/proxy-simple.js`
- Fixed console log output to match actual target URL

## Current Status üéØ

‚úÖ **Both proxy files now run successfully without errors**
- `proxy.js` - Configurable proxy with dynamic route building
- `proxy-simple.js` - Simple hardcoded proxy setup

## Known Issues ‚ö†Ô∏è

### Security Vulnerabilities
- 6 npm audit vulnerabilities detected (4 moderate, 2 critical)
- Located in `form-data` and `tough-cookie` dependencies
- **Decision**: Left unfixed to avoid breaking changes
- **Reason**: Fixing requires downgrading Redbird from v1.0.2 to v0.4.15 (major version change)
- **Impact**: Current code works with v1.0.2 API; downgrade would require significant refactoring

## Usage üöÄ

### Start the configurable proxy:
```bash
node proxy.js
```

### Start the simple proxy:
```bash
node proxy-simple.js
```

Both proxies will start successfully and register their routes without errors.
